Provide extended locale data for Java 1.6 supporting
  * Bosnian and SerboCroation local based on http://klaus.e175.net/java-locale-sh
  * Galician based on http://www.javagalician.org/

Note: simply adding this library to your project wont work.
You need to put this library into your jre/lib/ext directory.
After restarting the JVM, the new locales are available.

This project does not depend on any other porject except the runtime itself because it is a JDK extension.
